# Two Scoops of Django 2.2 Code Examples
The official repo for Two Scoops of Django 1.11 code samples migrated to Django 2.2

## Why We Are Doing This:

We aren't releasing a new edition of our book. Even with the 2.2 release, everything in Two Scoops of Django 1.11 will work without modification. However, for the sake of convienance, we've provided updated code examples here that work with Django 2.2 and Python 3.6. 

## Buy Our book

The title says "Two Scoops of Django 1.11", but it works fine with Django 2.2. We know, because we're using it in production ourselves.
